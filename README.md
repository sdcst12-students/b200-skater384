# Review of Tuples and lists

Requirements

You need to remember the following:
* difference between a tuple and a list
* how to access the member elements of a tuple and list
* how to use a for loop with a tuple and list
* how to make a copy of a tuple as a list (or vice versa)

Working with lists:
Some important commands to know:
listname.append()
listname.index()
listName.insert()
listName.count()
listName.pop()
listName.reverse()
listName.sort()

## Assignment:
Open up the file called 200a-Review.py and create the code to make each function work.  You will need to create your own function calls in the main block to test out your functions.  You may use the existing lists to test your functions, or create some of your own.
